# The `target` directory is generated by Cargo.
# It will contain mostly compiled files and executables.
target/*

# But the API documentation eventually gets published, so we want to
# make sure these files are also included in commits for downstream
# services to consume, and these are by default output to `target/doc`.
!target/doc
target/doc/*
!target/doc/index.html

# Other ignores go here.
